# Example to assign a value to a variable
v = 100
# here v is the variable's name, 100 is a value assigned to variable v. 
# after the above line of code is executed, v is an integer with value of 100.
# this can be checked as below
print(v)

# bad/unaceptable variable name: it's first letter should be number
#1a = 100
#print(1a)

# age = 10
# grade = 5
# name = "Jordan"

# Assign a with a integer value; now a is integer variable
a = 100
# to check if a is 100, let's print its value as below
print(a)
print(type(a))
print('the value of a is {}'.format(a))
print()

# assign variable a with a float value. Now a is float variable
a = 100.9
# to check if a is 100.9, let's print its value as below
print(a)
print(type(a))
print('the value of a is {}'.format(a))
