# Welcome to Python Programming  Boys!

## Introduction of ourselves
	Edward, Ernest, Jordan, Simon, Hairong
## What is Python?
	- a program language, one of the most popular
	- flexible and Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than other languages such as C++ and Java

	- easy to use
## How is Python Used?		
	- you can do almost anything with it
	- automate tasks
	- example of use: Google search, YouTube
	- even web development 
	- machine leaning, AI, computer vison
Demo: night vision camera with machine learning

## Install Python using Anaconda

## Interactive mode and script mode in Python

## Summary of learning today
- concept of data type: int, float, string
- concept of variable: a name fo storage. We used cups (each taped with a different name on it) to represent variables. And drop a spiece of paper that has a string  or number written on).
- five builtin Pyhton functions: 
	* print(): display strings or numbers onto screen 
	* input(): take string(s) from keyboard
	* type(): find the data type of a variable. It can be int, float, str, etc.
	* len(): count the length of a string, in other words, the number of letters/symbols within the string
	* int(): convert string to integer
