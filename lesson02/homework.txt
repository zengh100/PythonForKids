Write Pyhton code that asks for two numbers entered from keyboad, then display the subtraction of two numbers.
hints:
- use input('.....') to get number from keyboard input
- store each input to a viriable. So you will have two variables
- subtruct the two variables and stor the result to a third variable.
- use print() to display the third variable
